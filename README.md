# Vallado

A mirror of the astrodynamics software packages available from [Celestrak](https://celestrak.com/software/vallado-sw.php).

They are companion to *Fundamentals of Astrodynamics and Applications* by David Vallado

This mirror exists because the existing github mirrors where out of date or missing one of the languages.

It is automatically updated by github actions on a weekly basis.

The licenses, if any, can be found in the individual packages.

*Note*: executables are **not** included to reduce repo bloat.
