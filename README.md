# Vallado

A mirror of the Astrodynamics software packages available from [Celestrak](https://celestrak.com/software/vallado-sw.php).

They are companion to *Fundamentals of Astrodynamics and Applications* by David Vallado

This mirror exists as I found existing github mirrors to be out of date or missing one of the languages.

It is automatically updated by github actions on a weekly basis.

The licenses if any, can be found in the individual packages.

*Note*: executables are **not** included to reduce repo bloat.
